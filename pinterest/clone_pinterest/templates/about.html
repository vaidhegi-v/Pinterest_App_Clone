        If you click through the Pin, you can visit the website to find out how to make it or where to buy it. As you discover Pins you love, click the red Save button to save them to your boards. Tried the perfect birthday cake recipe? Add a comment to tell people how it went or add helpful tips.

Sometimes you'll find a Pin that you know a friend will love. Click the share icon to send Pins directly to a friend or group in a message to pass the inspiration around. You can also use messages to chat to your friends.
